# Snake Scales

The official snake scales repository.

## Installation

Scale can be installed in one of three ways, using snake, pip or by cloning the respository and pointing Snake to it.

Once installed Snake and the Celery workers must be restarted.

> Note: Any missing dependencies or configuration settings will be reported in Snake's log!

### Snake Based

The Snake command line utility can be used to install a scale.

```bash
snake install SCALE_NAME
```

The Snake command line utility can also be used to check the loadable state of a scale.
This is very useful when a scale has multiple dependencies.

```bash
snake check SCALE_NAME
```

### Pip Based

A scale can be installed using pip as follows:

```bash
# 1. Install the scale with pip
pip install 'git+https://github.com/countercept/snake-scales#egg=<SCALE>&subdirectory=<SCALE>'

# 2. (Optional) Copy scales conf file if present to /etc/snake/scales
export SCALE=<SCALE>
export SCALE_DIR=`python -c "import imp; print(imp.find_module('snake_${SCALE}')[1])"`
if [ -f "${SCALE_DIR}/${SCALE}.conf" ]; then cp "${SCALE_DIR}/${SCALE}.conf" "/etc/snake/scales/${SCALE}.conf.example"; fi

# 3. Install system dependencies
# If any, these will be reported in the Snake log, or usually listed in the `check` functions within components
```

### Clone Based

All the scales from a repository can easily be added to Snake, just by cloning and pointing.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository to the desired location
git clone https://github.com/countercept/snake-scales.git <SCALE_DIR>

# 2. Add directory to snake.conf
[snip]
snake_scale_dirs: [
  '<SCALE_DIR>'
]
[snip]

# 3. (Optional) Copy scales conf files if present to /etc/snake/scales
# Check through the scales folders and copy their .conf files if present to /etc/snake/scales

# 4. Install python requirements
# If any, either look through the setup.py files or look at the Snake log.

# 5. Install system dependencies
# If any, these will be reported in the Snake log, or usually listed in the `check` functions within components
```
